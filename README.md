# AI-Powered Expense Tracker
This is my First College Mini Project Where I built an Expense Tracker Using ML.
A web-based app that uses machine learning to auto-categorize your expenses and visualize spending with real-time analytics.

## Features
- ML-based transaction categorization
- Responsive UI (Bootstrap)
- Pie chart analytics (Plotly)
- Budget management

## Run Locally
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
python train_model.py
python app.py
